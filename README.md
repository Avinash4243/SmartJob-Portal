# SmartJob-Portal
The SmartJob Portal is a training &amp; placement platform where:  Job Seekers (Candidates) can create a profile, upload resumes, search for jobs, and apply.  Employers (Companies) can post jobs, review applications, and hire candidates.  Admins manage the overall system (users, jobs, and applications).

Itâ€™s like a simplified version of Naukri, LinkedIn Jobs, or Indeed, but built with React (Frontend), Spring Boot Microservices (Backend), and AWS (Cloud Hosting).
